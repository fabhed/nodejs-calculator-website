To create a fully functioning calculator website using Node.js, we will need the following files:

1. package.json: To define the project and its dependencies.
2. server.js: The entry point for the application, which sets up the server and routes.
3. public/index.html: The HTML file containing the calculator UI.
4. public/styles.css: The CSS file for styling the calculator UI.
5. public/scripts.js: The JavaScript file for handling the calculator logic on the client side.

Let's start with the package.json file:
